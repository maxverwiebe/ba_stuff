  abstract   = {In order to handle spatial data efficiently, as required in computer aided design and geo-data applications, a database system needs an index mechanism that will help it retrieve data items quickly according to their spatial locations However, traditional indexing methods are not well suited to data objects of non-zero size located m multi-dimensional spaces In this paper we describe a dynamic index structure called an R-tree which meets this need, and give algorithms for searching and updating it. We present the results of a series of tests which indicate that the structure performs well, and conclude that it is useful for current database systems in spatial applications},

  abstract  = {Spatial indexing is a we researched field that benefited computer science with many outstanding results. Our effort in this paper can be seen as revisiting some outstanding contributions to spatial indexing, questioning some paradigms, and designing an access method with globally improved performance characteristics. In particular, we argue that dynamic R-tree construction is a typical clustering problem which can be addressed by incorporating existing clustering algorithms. As a working example, we adopt the well-known k-means algorithm. Further, we study the effect of relaxing the ``two-way'' split procedure and propose a ``multi-way'' split, which inherently is supported by clustering tech- niques. We compare our clustering approach to two prominent examples of spatial access methods, the R- and the R*-tree.},

  abstract   = {A frequently encountered type of query in Geographic Information Systems is to find the k nearest neighbor objects to a given point in space. Processing such queries requires substantially different search algorithms than those for location or range queries. In this paper we present an efficient branch-and-bound R-tree traversal algorithm to find the nearest neighbor object to a point, and then generalize it to finding the k nearest neighbors. We also discuss metrics for an optimistic and a pessimistic search ordering strategy as well as for pruning. Finally, we present the results of several experiments obtained using the implementation of our algorithm and examine the behavior of the metrics and the scalability of the algorithm.},
